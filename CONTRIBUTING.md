# How To contribute to Pear Leaf ORM

## Pull Requests

When a prll request is made, it must pass all quality checks.

## Coding Conventions

Pear Leaf ORM uses editorconfig to help maintain a coding standard, all IDEs support it so there shouldn't be an excuse in not following it.

an overview of what we follow:

you are to always use spaces, never tabs, you should be use 4 spaces, the only exception is json files which has to be 2 spaces.

always use a bracket, skipping them will get denied in pull request, the bracket should be after the keywords.

This is what I'll be looking for:

```php
if (condition) {
}
```
